# pond and sprinkler control using socketio es6 and angular2

Client app for pi circuit serving up on flask and socketio. Based upon github repos `ng2-play` and `angular2-authentication sample`

## Using it

This demo relies on a server running on a raspberry pi, https://github.com/mckennatim/cascada2pi. You'll need to clone it, run `npm install` then `npm start`. It will run a pi server on port 8087.

Then, you can run `npm install` and `npm start` on this project. `gulp watch`  will keep the dist(es5 version) updated. `gulp play will do that plus run a http server on 3000`
